-------------------------------------------------------

### Behaviour

This AI obeys the following logic:

* If a path from the head of the snake can be found:
	Attempt to find a path from the apple to the predicted location of the tail once the apple is reached (Accounting for the snake growing.) - uses a heuristic that minimises "jagged" movements. This path also assumes it can cross the rear end of the snake's body provided it is far enough from it's tail.

*	If this path can be found, follow the path to the apple.

* Else, find the longest path from the head of the snake to it's own tail. This path is constantly updated and attempts are made to find a valid path to the apple each step.
